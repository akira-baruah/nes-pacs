## Background

The NES uses an 8-bit processor, with a 16-bit address space, based on
the MOS Technology 6502.


## Objectives

Write working implementations of the following NES components in
SystemVerilog:

- Ricoh 2A03 processor (including audio processing unit)
- NES Picture Processing Unit (PPU)

Implement a regression test suite to ensure that the CPU and PPU excecute
instructions accurately. This will begin by writing simulations in quartus
and end with loading NES games onto the fpga.

## Project Team

This project is conducted as part of Stephen Edwards' [Embedded
Systems](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2016/4840-spring/index.html)
(CSEE 4840) course at Columbia University.
